In my contact file, I used classes for the user to input their first and last name as well as their email and phone number so that I can have the proper contacts to reach out and respond to the message that is typed in the message box at the bottom of the page.  I also have my navbar and links to each page at the top as well as my bootstrap link.

In my index file, I have put all of my information for my about me page. I put an image of myself and a short description of me.  I also have my navbar and links to each page at the top as well as my bootstrap link.

In my portfolio file, I have put in five 350x350 placeholder images. I also have my navbar and links to each page at the top as well as my bootstrap link.
